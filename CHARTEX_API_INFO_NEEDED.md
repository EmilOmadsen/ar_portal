CHARTEX API DOCUMENTATION NEEDED

Based on the credentials provided:
- App ID: emil_elmTTqJc
- App Token: 4IgvbHQ5cYN-F6O2yQLLw4N4LI3MxjLXtNoNhvqWyy`

We need to know:
1. The correct base URL (tried https://api.chartex.io - connection failed)
2. The API endpoint structure
3. Authentication method (Bearer token? Header format?)

Please provide:
- API documentation link
- Example cURL request
- Or screenshots of working API calls

Once we have this information, we can:
✅ Fetch TikTok trending tracks with historical data
✅ Fetch Spotify streaming data with daily breakdowns
✅ Detect evergreen tracks (10k+ daily for 365 days)
✅ Identify cross-platform trending (TikTok + Spotify)
✅ Filter by indie labels only

ALTERNATIVE: If Chartex doesn't have public docs, please share any
example requests or response formats you have access to.
